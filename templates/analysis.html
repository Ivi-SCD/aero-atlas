            <h2>1. Landsat Satellite Data Overview</h2>
            <p>This analysis utilizes data from the Landsat satellite series, specifically Landsat 8 and Landsat 9, which are integral to NASA's Earth observation program. As an geospatial technologies enthusiast, I find Landsat data invaluable for its consistent long-term coverage and multispectral capabilities based on searchs and studies before hackathon.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Characteristics:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Temporal Resolution: 16-day revisit cycle</li>
                <li>Spatial Resolution: 30 meters for most bands, 15 meters for panchromatic</li>
                <li>Spectral Resolution: 11 bands, including visible, near-infrared, short-wave infrared, and thermal</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I'd use this data for comprehensive land cover analysis because of its excellent balance between spatial and spectral resolution. The 30-meter resolution is particularly suitable for regional-scale studies, while the variety of spectral bands allows for nuanced differentiation between land cover types.</p>

            <h3>Bands Used in This Analysis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Band 2 (Blue): 0.452-0.512 µm</li>
                <li>Band 3 (Green): 0.533-0.590 µm</li>
                <li>Band 4 (Red): 0.636-0.673 µm</li>
                <li>Band 5 (Near Infrared, NIR): 0.851-0.879 µm</li>
                <li>Band 6 (Short-wave Infrared 1, SWIR1): 1.566-1.651 µm</li>
                <li>Band 7 (Short-wave Infrared 2, SWIR2): 2.107-2.294 µm</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In my experience, the combination of these bands provides an optimal dataset for calculating a wide range of spectral indices. The inclusion of SWIR bands is particularly crucial for advanced indices like MNDWI and AWEI, which I've found to be superior in discriminating water bodies in complex landscapes.</p>

        <section class="analysis-section">
            <h2>2. Calculation Methods for Indices</h2>
            
            <h3>2.1 Vegetation Indices</h3>
            
            <h4>NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)</h4>
            <p>NDVI is a fundamental index in remote sensing. I frequently use it as a baseline for vegetation analysis due to its simplicity and effectiveness.</p>
            <p class="formula">NDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)</p>
            <code>ndvi = (nir_band - red_band) / (nir_band + red_band)</code>
            <p>I'd use NDVI for quick assessments of vegetation health and density. However, it's important to note its limitations in areas with high biomass due to saturation effects.</p>

            <h4>EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index)</h4>
            <p>EVI is my go-to index for areas with dense vegetation where NDVI might saturate. Its ability to reduce atmospheric influences makes it particularly valuable for time-series analysis.</p>
            <p class="formula">EVI = 2.5 * ((NIR - Red) / (NIR + 6 * Red - 7.5 * Blue + 1))</p>
            <code>evi = 2.5 * ((nir_band - red_band) / (nir_band + 6 * red_band - 7.5 * blue_band + 1))</code>
            <p>I've found EVI to be superior in tropical regions where atmospheric effects can significantly impact other indices.</p>

            <h4>SAVI (Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index)</h4>
            <p>SAVI is crucial for arid and semi-arid environments where soil background can significantly influence vegetation indices.</p>
            <p class="formula">SAVI = ((NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red + L)) * (1 + L)</p>
            <code>savi = ((nir_band - red_band) / (nir_band + red_band + L)) * (1 + L)</code>
            <p>Where L is a soil brightness correction factor. I typically use L = 0.5, but I've experimented with dynamically adjusting L based on vegetation density for more accurate results in heterogeneous landscapes.</p>

            <h3>2.2 Water Indices</h3>
            
            <h4>NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index)</h4>
            <p>NDWI is effective for delineating open water features and enhancing their presence in remotely sensed digital imagery.</p>
            <p class="formula">NDWI = (Green - NIR) / (Green + NIR)</p>
            <code>ndwi = (green_band - nir_band) / (green_band + nir_band)</code>
            <p>I primarily use NDWI for mapping surface water bodies and assessing vegetation liquid water content.</p>

            <h4>MNDWI (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index)</h4>
            <p>MNDWI is my preferred index for water body mapping, especially in urban areas where NDWI can struggle.</p>
            <p class="formula">MNDWI = (Green - SWIR1) / (Green + SWIR1)</p>
            <code>mndwi = (green_band - swir1_band) / (green_band + swir1_band)</code>
            <p>The use of SWIR instead of NIR makes MNDWI particularly effective at distinguishing water from built-up areas, which is crucial for urban hydrology studies.</p>

            <h4>AWEI (Automated Water Extraction Index)</h4>
            <p>AWEI is an advanced index that I've found to be exceptionally useful in complex landscapes where shadows or urban features might be confused with water.</p>
            <p class="formula">AWEI = 4 * (Green - SWIR1) - (0.25 * NIR + 2.75 * SWIR2)</p>
            <code>awei = 4 * (green_band - swir1_band) - (0.25 * nir_band + 2.75 * swir2_band)</code>
            <p>In my work with NASA's water resource management projects, AWEI has proven invaluable for accurately mapping ephemeral water bodies in arid regions.</p>
